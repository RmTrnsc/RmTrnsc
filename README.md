I'm a __full-stack develope__ in a dental prosthesis company in __France__


I'm in charge of several projects:
1. Relational between dental practices and labs (chat, orders, product list, quotes, online documents ...)
2. In-house logistics for sending parcels to the practices
3. Similar to the first one with a few peculiarities as it is specific to only one laboratory
4. An internal application for holiday requests, pay slips, badging, etc...
