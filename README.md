<h3>I'm a <b><ins>full-stack developer</ins></b> in a dental prosthesis company in <b><ins>France</ins></b></h3>

I'm in charge of several projects:

1. Relational between dental practices and labs (chat, orders, product list, quotes, online documents ...)
2. In-house logistics for sending parcels to the practices
3. Similar to the first one with a few peculiarities as it is specific to only one laboratory
4. An internal application for holiday requests, pay slips, badging, etc...
